Hi there!

I'm Lucas Reyna (he/him) - a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area

I studied Computer Engineering at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo from 2019 to 2023. Since then, I've been working at Niantic, Inc as an engineer working on different products related to their [Augmented Reality platform](https://www.nianticspatial.com/products/understand).

I have a strong interest in mobile application development, computer graphics, and mixed reality.

Outside of software, I enjoy hobbyist CAD-ing for small electronics or 3D printables.

Please don't hesitate to reach out!
